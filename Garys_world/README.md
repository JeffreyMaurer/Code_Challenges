This is a very, very simple game meant to show how reinforcement learning works. The point is to get the score to be as large as possible. You control gary, and he has 5 actions: stay or move left, right, up or down. As you can see, using the table (because this is a discrete world) works a lot faster than using a neural network. However, with this certain seed, the agent using either method finds the local minimum and is not able to learn to reach and stay at the global maximum.
