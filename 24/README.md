The game 24 is one where you deal 4 cards from a regular deck in front of a group. The first person to use the values of all of the cards and unary or binary arithmetic operations to produce the value 24.

For example, let's say I deal 3 8 2 A. Ace counts as 1. Here, you can produce 24 as such: (3!)*(8/2)*1.

This program determines all the possible ways to get a certain value.
