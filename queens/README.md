The n-queens problem is the question of how you can place n-queens on an nxn chessboard such that no two queens have the ability to capture each other in the next turn.

This is a fun problem, because not only can we calculate the positions of a solution, but we can also calculate the number of unique solutions. This can take into account how many solutions are simple reflections or rotations of other solutions.

Also, it can be proven that in higher dimensions, for example, a 3D chessboard where the board is nxnxn, we can fit nxn 3D queen analogues. The solutions and number of solutions can be easily calculated.

The code is in both python and c++. c++ for speed of running and python for speed of writing.
