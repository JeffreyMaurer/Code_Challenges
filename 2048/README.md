2048 is a game where the board is 4x4 tiles large, and each can either be empty or contain a numerical value. Each action is defined as one of the four directions (up, down, left, right). On an action, all numbered tiles move to that side as far as they can without overlapping with another  tile of a different value. If two tiles of the same value shift into each other, then that numerical value is doubled. After the tiles move a 2 tile is added to a random empty tile, though 10% of the time, a 4 is added. 

The goal is to construct a 2048 tile.
