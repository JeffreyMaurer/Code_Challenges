In the Simpsons, there is an episode where Homer becomes temporarily smart. In one instance, he writes down a contradiction to Fermat's last theorem.

However, it's not a true contradiction. The error is so small that it exceeds the number of significant figures when using a run-of-the-mill calculator.

On the numberphile video I saw about this, they state that the simpsons used a strong computer to find that approximate solution... but I thought that it wouldn't take THAT much computing power to solve for. Thus, I wrote this little program. It doesn't take long at all to run and find the exact solution that the Simpsons found.
