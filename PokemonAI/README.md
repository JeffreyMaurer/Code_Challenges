This is how I shall try to teach an AI to play Pokemon.

I start with a very simple system: three types of pokemon, each with a move of their type and a neutral move. THe AI needs to learn how to play the game.

Hopefully, I could scale it up somehow to try to get it to play the actual pokemon game. However, I see making a team as its hardest task: There are 2.6e+17 possible 6-member pokemon teams, each with around 9.4e+7 possible 4 move sets (assuming most pokemon have around 100 moves to choose from). This doesn't even take into account the number of different pokemon forms (increasing the number of possible pokemon to choose from), choosing a moveset with less than 4 moves (situationally useful), held items (there are between 100 and 1000 possible), natures (30) and EV spread (508 split between 6 stats, each with a max of 252).

Let's see how well I can do!
