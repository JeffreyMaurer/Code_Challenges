This is how I shall try to teach an AI to play Pokemon.

I start with a very simple system: three types of pokemon, each with a move of their type and a neutral move. THe AI needs to learn how to play the game.

Hopefully, I could scale it up somehow to try to get it to play the actual pokemon game. However, I see making a team as its hardest task: there are approximately 10^30 initial teams when accounting for Pokemon and move choice, not even accounting for held items, abilities to choose, nature and EV spread.

Let's see how well I can do!
